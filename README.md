cc65 is a complete cross development package for 65(C)02 systems, including
a powerful macro assembler, a C compiler, linker, librarian and several
other tools.

This compiler toolchain has been enhanced to support the new quantum computing
instructions supported by the [vm6502q](https://github.com/vm6502q/vm6502q)
emulator.

The changes live on the `6502q` branch.
